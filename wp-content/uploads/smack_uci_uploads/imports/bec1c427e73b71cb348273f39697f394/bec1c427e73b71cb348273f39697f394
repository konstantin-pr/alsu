If you want to play some of the new games, you’ll need to turn up early (the more fanatical mill around the station area all night and then queue up from 5am) and know exactly where you’re going when you get inside. The queues at the entrance ease up around noon, so if you turn up before that, bring liquid refreshment and a hat as the weather in this part of Japan is still hot in September.

CEEGS,pending review,gamedev,,http://2018.ceegs.eu/,11.10.2018,13.10.2018,"Prague, Czech Republic",Prague,Czech Republic,"CEEGS (Central and Eastern European Game Studies conference) is a gathering of game scholars organized annually by academics from the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but its thematic scope is not limited to regional topics, and it welcomes participants from anywhere in the world.
The 2018 conference will be hosted by the Film Faculty of Prague’s Academy of Performing Arts, which will be opening the country’s first Master’s game design program in 2019. Our first two confirmed keynote speakers are Clara Fernández-Vara (New York University) and Jesper Juul (Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts).

Theme & Scope
Although often considered toys, entertainment products, and pastimes disconnected from the real life, games have been recognized by both academics and designers as a means to express ideas, opinions, feelings, and experiences. Games can promote or subvert ideology, induce hope or fear, or make us feel empathy or enmity towards their characters. Games are never completely innocent, and always – in ways both subtle and explicit – interact with the social or political context; they provide us with designed experiences intended to make us feel or think in certain ways.

The fifth annual CEEGS conference wants to bring focus to the expressive potential of digital and non-digital games. It aims to explore what - and how - is expressed through games and how players interact with and interpret ludic expressions in their own practices. We welcome academic contributions related to the exploration of games as an expressive medium from any relevant disciplinary perspective, including the following topics:
* structural and ontological properties of games as a medium of expression
* aesthetic explorations of games
* histories of ludic expressions
* relationship of games to other media
* games and affect
* game design as an interdisciplinary and reflective endeavor
* sociology and ethnography of game design
* technology and computation as an opportunity or obstacle in ludic expression
* local, regional, and international trends in game design and game cultures
* player reception of ludic expressions
* subversive and transgressive game design and gameplay
* critique of design and industry paradigms
* current trends in game industries and their effects on content of games
* in-game representations of real-life events and social phenomena
* games, activism and tactical media
* the “indie” game paradigm and expressivity
* fringe and outsider games
* game design education between the needs of industry and artistic visions
* expressions about games - player and fan discourses
* players’ expressions beyond gameplay

This year, CEEGS will host three workshops, all of which will take place on October 11. Workshops are more informal venues for discussion of work-in-progress research and other related topics in game studies and education. To be able to participate in a workshop, you must register for CEEGS 2018. Acceptance into the program of the main conference, however, is not required for participation in the workshop. Workshop submission deadlines are August 31, 2018. Please see the individual calls below.

Retro Gaming Expo, Inc. is a Portland, Oregon-based 501(c)4 non-profit cooperative organization dedicated to creating awareness of, and appreciation for classic video and arcade games through the presentation of events and conventions that celebrate the historic contribution video games have made and continue to make in popular culture.

Our Goals
PRGE seeks to continually improve the quality and depth of our events. It is through events like our annual Expo that we will meet our goals:

Educate
Our primary mission is to educate our visitors on the impact that video games have made on our society. Our main methods for doing this are through hands-on interaction with classic games and by hosting speaking engagemments from important figures from video game history.

Preserve
The first consumer video games were created over 40 years ago. As years pass and new systems replaced the old, it does not always occur to game manufacturers and owners to preserve examples of their games for the future. PRGE believes that, by demonstrating original game hardware and software in working condition, we provide a clearer example of video game culture through the years and a better experience for our attendees.

Inspire
Video games bring together multiple disciplines including mathematics, physics, art, music and drama. It is our belief that by highlighting video games of the past, we will inspire the game creators of the future in all of these areas.

What is a classic video game?
Our loose definition of a classic video game is any from a system released prior to the most recent generation by any game manufacturer. By this definition the Nintendo Wii, XBox 360 and Playstation 3 have moved into the classic realm (replaced by the Wii U, XBoxOne and Playstation 4 respectively). In regard to full-size arcade cabinet games we have, somewhat arbitrarily, chosen games older than 10 years as eligible for classic status.","777 NE Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Portland, OR 97232, USA",

Furthermore, there will be plenty of opportunities to meet new people in our exhibition area, at our meeting zones and at the legendary Gamesforum party.

Why is your event cross platform?
We believe that barriers between platforms are dissolving. While mobile, console and PC still retain their own distinct characteristics – which need to be respected – the extent to which they divide the industry and by which games are enclosed by them has never been more in question.
Game developers are pushing at the edges of the boundaries between console and PC, with games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds and Minecraft spreading across platforms.
Additionally, hardware creators such as Nintendo and Razer are redefining the divisions between device categories with the line between mobile, console and PC hardware becoming ever harder to define.
Finally, business models and practices are permeating between each sector. At the same time as we see console and PC developers embrace games as a service, we increasingly see mobile developers focusing on strengthening their brands and enriching their game mechanics to maintain their competitive edge.
Therefore, we believe that a cross platform focus will help us to best serve the industry and – as a result of that – the players who make it what it is.","2211 Alaskan Way, Seattle, WA 98121, USA",https://youtu.be/YJAiSHxr-dE

To sign up, you’ll need to create a 2-minute video of you and up to 4 of your friends (5 total) performing your act. Please refrain from doing a lot of post-production work or adding camera-angle shifts—we want to see your act as it would be performed on stage! 

Costume contest
The Costume Contest returns in a brand-new, better than ever format, and we just can’t wait to see what sort of fantastic creations you’ll take to center stage this year! As always, the number of contestants will be limited, and your creation must meet all requirements to be eligible for one of the 25 spots in this most prestigious of cosplay competitions. But fear not, there will be plenty of other chances for you to strut your stuff at BlizzCon!

Cosplay Exhibition
We know a lot of people enjoy seeing everyone’s costuming creativity on display — and that’s why in we’re planning to add a separate cosplay exhibition taking place the afternoon before Community Night.
While the cosplay contest will showcase the top 25, this exhibition will give more people an opportunity to show off their work (including a mix of top-25 finalists and awesome costumes that didn’t quite make the final contest cut) and walk one of the stages at BlizzCon. Registration to participate will also be required; stay tuned for more details on our plans.","800 W Katella Ave, Anaheim, CA 92802, USA",https://youtu.be/hprjDVz0aoI

Motion plays a crucial role in interactive applications, such as VR, AR, and video games. Characters move around, objects are manipulated or move due to physical constraints, entities are animated, and the camera moves through the scene. Even the motion of the player nowadays is used as input to such interactive systems.

Motion is currently studied in many different areas of research, including graphics and animation, game technology, robotics, simulation, computer vision, and also physics, psychology, and urban studies. Cross-fertilization between these communities can considerably advance the state-of-the-art in the area.

The goal of the Motion, Interaction and Games conference is to bring together researchers from this variety of fields to present their most recent results, to initiate collaborations, and to contribute to the establishment of the research area. The conference will consist of regular paper sessions, poster presentations, and as well as presentations by a selection of internationally renowned speakers in all areas related to interactive systems and simulation.
